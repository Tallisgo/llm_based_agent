    "  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.\n",

    "     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.\n",
    "     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.\n",
    "  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.\n",
    "     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.\n",
    "     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.\n",
    "  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.\n",
